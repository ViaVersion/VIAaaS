## How does it work?

- [ViaVersion](https://viaversion.com), [ViaBackwards](https://viaversion.com/backwards)
  and [ViaRewind](https://viaversion.com/rewind) translates the connections to backend server.
- VIAaaS auth page stores account credentials in the player's browser local storage.
- It uses a CORS Proxy for calling Mojang APIs.
- Account credentials aren't sent to VIAaaS instance by default.
- The web page receives and validates the join game request from VIAaaS instance.

## Setting up server instance

Download: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ViaVersion/VIAaaS/actions) (needs to be logged into GitHub)
or [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/com/github/ViaVersion/VIAaaS/master-SNAPSHOT/VIAaaS-master-SNAPSHOT-all.jar)

### How to download and start VIAaaS server:

```sh
curl -Lf --output VIAaaS-all.jar "https://jitpack.io/com/github/ViaVersion/VIAaaS/master-SNAPSHOT/VIAaaS-master-SNAPSHOT-all.jar"
java -jar VIAaaS-all.jar
```

- Requires Java 17
- Default Minecraft: ```via.localhost``` with port 25565
- Default HTTPS: ```https://localhost:25543/```

### How to create a public server

- You need a DNS wildcard pointing to VIAaaS instance, like ``*.example.com -> 192.168.123.123``.
- Configure the hostname in the config
- Open the Minecraft port (25565)
- The HTTPS page needs a valid SSL certificate, you can use a reverse proxy like [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) (with
  a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate).
- You'll need to configure a Azure Client ID, edit ```config/web/js/config.js``` (default is in the jar) and
  configure your [Azure Client ID](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Microsoft_authentication).

## Usage for players

You'll need to specify which server you want to connect through address parameters
added as prefix in ``via.localhost`` or via web page (default https://localhost:25543/).

#### Offline mode:

- Connect to ```mc.example.net.via.localhost```

#### Online mode:

Web login:

- Go to VIAaaS auth webpage (default is https://localhost:25543/)
- Listen to the username A (you'll use it to connect to the VIAaaS instance).
- Add the account B (you'll use it in backend server).
- Keep the page open
- Connect with your account A to ```mc.example.com._u(account B).via.localhost```
- Approve the login in the webpage

Web login via token caching:

- Open the web page and save your account in your browser
- Send your access token to the instance. After that you can close the page.
- Connect to ```mc.example.com.via.localhost``` with the account you sent the token.

Fabric/Forge client:

- Install [OpenAuthMod](https://github.com/RaphiMC/OpenAuthMod) in your client.
- Join the server: ```mc.example.net.via.localhost```
- Approve the login

### Address options

#### Example address:

- ```server.example.net._p25565._v1_12_2._of._uBACKUSERNAME.via.example.com```
- ```server.example.net.v_1_8.via.example.com```

#### Address parts:

- You can use ``(option)_(value)`` too, like ``p_25565``.
- ```server.example.net```: backend server address
- ```_p```: backend port
- ```_v```: backend version ([protocol id](https://wiki.vg/Protocol_version_numbers) or name, replace ``.`` with ``_``)
  . ```AUTO``` is default (with 1.8 as fallback).
- ```_o```: ```true``` to force online mode in frontend, ```false``` to force offline mode in frontend. If not set, it
  will be based on backend online mode.
- ```_u```: username to use in backend connection (default is front-end username)
- ```via.example.com```: instance address (defined in config)

## WARNING

- VIAaaS may trigger anti-cheats, due to block, item, movement and other differences between versions. USE AT OWN RISK.
- Take care of browser local storage. Check for XSS vulnerabilities on your domain.
- Check the security of CORS proxy, it will be used for calling to Mojang API.

## FAQ

### Accounts

#### Why to use an online webpage for online mode?:

- It's easier to maintain in that way, because providing login via chat requires encoding and decoding more packets,
  which reduces maintainability.
- It allows your account password and token to be kept with you.

### Connection

#### How to use IPv6?:

- The hostname parser currently doesn't support direct IPv6, but you can use a DNS name with https://sslip.io/

#### I'm getting a DNS error/"Unknown host" while connecting to via.localhost

- Try configuring ```via.localho.st``` as hostname suffix instead

#### How to use with Geyser?

- Set the parameters in Geyser's `address` field:
  ```yml
  remote:
    # The IP address of the remote (Java Edition) server
    address: 2b2t.org._v1_12_2.via.localhost
  ```
- If you are using GeyserConnect: connect to a publicly available VIAaaS instance,
  like ```mc.example.com._v1_8.via.example.net``` as a Java Edition server.

#### Can you support more versions / Is there some alternative?

- See [ViaProxy](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaProxy)

#### Can I customize the files of HTTP server?

- Add files to ``config/web/`` directory
